            <p>Your life is shorter than mine. You have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. And the wages of your sin(s) is eternal hell.</p>
            <p>But there's good news.</p>

            <p>God demonstrates His own love for us in this: While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. That whosever believes in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life.</p>
